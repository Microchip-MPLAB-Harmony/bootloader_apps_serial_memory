# FS SPI Flash Bootloader

This example application shows how to use the File System Bootloader Library to bootload an application from SPI Flash memory \(SST26\) to Internal Flash.

**Bootloader Application**

-   This is a File System based bootloader application which resides from

    -   The starting location of the Boot flash memory region for PIC32MZ devices

        -   Uses a Custom linker script **btl.ld** to place it in Boot flash memory

-   It uses the Harmony 3 File System Framework to read the application binary **\(image.bin\)** stored in **SPI Flash Memory** and program it into **Internal flash memory**

-   It glows an LED once bootloader firmware is running

-   Trigger Methods

    -   It uses the On board Switch OR a GPIO pin as bootloader trigger pin to force enter the bootloader at reset of device

    -   It checks for bootloader request pattern **\(0x5048434D\)** from the starting 16 Bytes of RAM to force enter bootloader at reset of device


**Programmer Application**

-   This is a File system based SPI Flash programmer application which resides from

    -   The start of Program Flash memory for PIC32MZ devices

-   It will be loaded into **internal flash memory** from **SPI Flash Memory** by bootloader application

-   Uses the Virtual Com port of the device \(EDBG port or External USB to UART converters\) to send console messages


**It Consist of three tasks**

1.  **SDCARD\_Tasks\(\):**

    -   Receives the binary file **image.bin** to be copied into SPI Flash from SD Card

        -   As the application running in internal flash should have capability to copy new binary file to SPI Flash memory, we copy the **programmer application binary itself** in SPI Flash Memory

    -   Prints copying status on UART console

2.  **SERIAL\_MEM\_Tasks\(\):**

    -   Formats the SPI Flash memory to **FAT File System if not formatted**

    -   Copies the binary file received by **SDCARD\_Tasks\(\)** to **image.bin** file in SPI Flash Memory. The copied **image.bin** from SPI Flash memory will be read by bootloader and programmed into internal flash

    -   Prints messages on UART console

3.  **APP\_MONITOR\_Tasks\(\):**

    -   Blinks an LED every 1 second

    -   Prints messages on UART console

    -   Uses On board Switch OR a GPIO pin to trigger bootloader once copying of image binary to SPI Flash memory is complete
