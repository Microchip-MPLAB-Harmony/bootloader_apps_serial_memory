## Bootloader Application

|Project Name|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|bootloader/firmware/pic32mz\_ef\_sk.X|MPLABX project for [PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity with FPU \(EF\) Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320007)|

## Programmer application

|Project Name|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|app\_programmer/firmware/pic32mz\_ef\_sk.X|MPLABX project for [PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity with FPU \(EF\) Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320007)|

## Setting up [PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity with FPU \(EF\) Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/Dm320007)

-   Connect a mini USB cable to the UART-USB port J11

-   For programming, connect a mini USB cable to the USB Debug port J3


## Setting up the host script

-   Refer to [UART Host Script Help](GUID-68689A7C-FEE2-4993-A6B4-0F4C71163040.md) for setting up the **uart\_host.py** utility used to send the application binary from host PC

    -   There will be no reset command sent from host after programming by default.

    -   Reboot command has to be sent separately only after successful programming to trigger bootloader from **programmer application**


## Running the Application

1.  Open the bootloader project *bootloader/firmware/pic32mz\_ef\_sk.X* in the IDE

2.  Make sure that the *app\_programmer/firmware/pic32mz\_ef\_sk.X* is added as a loadable project to bootloader application

    -   As the QSPI Flash memory may not have any valid binary **required by bootloader** for the first time, Adding the **app\_programmer as loadable** allows MPLAB X to create a **unified hex file** and program both these applications in their respective memory locations based on their linker script configurations

    ![mplab_loadable_pic32mz_ef_sk](GUID-80482082-A917-4B5C-8C25-B1FD41A1D2B2-low.png)

3.  Build and program the **bootloader application** using the IDE

4.  Once programming is done bootloader starts execution and directly jumps to application space to **run the programmer application**

    -   **LED3** starts blinking indicating that the **programmer application** is running

5.  Open the programmer application project *app\_programmer/firmware/pic32mz\_ef\_sk.X* in the IDE

6.  Update **app\_programmer/firmware/src/config/pic32mz\_ef\_sk/user.h** to use **LED2** instead of **LED3** as below

    ```c
    	#define LED_TOGGLE()            LED2_Toggle()
    ```

7.  Clean and Build the project to generate the binary **\(Do not program the binary\)**

8.  Run the **uart\_host.py** from command prompt to program the **updated programmer application binary** in QSPI Flash memory

    ```
     python <harmony3_path>/bootloader_apps_serial_memory/tools/uart_host.py -v -i <COM PORT> -d pic32mz -a 0x9D000000 -f <harmony3_path>/bootloader_apps_serial_memory/apps/qspi_flash_bootloader/app_programmer/firmware/pic32mz_ef_sk.X/dist/pic32mz_ef_sk/production/pic32mz_ef_sk.X.production.bin
    ```

9.  Following snapshot shows output of successfully programming the **programmer application**

    -   **LED3** should still be blinking

    ![uart_host_output_program](GUID-A9E2EECF-E1C3-4C52-8AF2-40DA9CA0B149-low.png)

10. Run the **uart\_host.py** from command prompt to send a **Reboot** command. This command Updates **MetaData** and **triggers Bootloader** to program the **updated binary from QSPI Flash to Internal Flash**

    ```
    python <harmony3_path>/bootloader_apps_serial_memory/tools/uart_host.py -v -i <COM PORT> -r
    ```

    ![uart_host_output_reboot](GUID-AFAD1DA9-5F7C-4E7A-8878-DE4B72BC81DD-low.png)

11. Once Firmware Update is successful **LED2** should start blinking indicating updated programmer application running

    -   If there was any error you may need to power cycle the device to retry firmware upgrade

12. Update **app\_programmer/firmware/src/config/pic32mz\_ef\_sk/user.h** to revert to **LED3** from **LED2** as below

    ```c
    #define LED_TOGGLE()            LED3_Toggle()
    ```

13. Clean and Build the project to generate the binary **\(Do not program the binary\)**

14. Repeat Step 8-9.

    -   You should see **LED2** still blinking

15. Press the Switch **SW1** to Update **MetaData** and **trigger Bootloader** to program the **updated binary from QSPI Flash to Internal Flash**

16. Once Firmware Update is successful **LED3** should start blinking indicating updated programmer application running

    -   If there was any error you may need to power cycle the device to retry firmware upgrade


## Additional Steps \(Optional\)

-   To bootload any other application refer to [Application Configurations](GUID-A4C196CF-3963-4FBC-8519-B5F03A031812.md)

    -   **Note that this application should have programming capabilities to QSPI Flash Memory**

-   Once done repeat the applicable steps mentioned in [Running The Application](#running-the-application)
